# Sudoku
A program to create your own sudoku games, or solve a computer generated game at different difficulty levels.

Sudoku is a game where the objective is to create a special arrangement of the numbers 1-9
in a 9x9 box.

This code allows you to create your own sudoku game or have one made for you. From there,
you can either solve the puzzle youself, or have the computer solve it for you. Once solved,
you can backtrack through the steps to the solution.

From Wikipedia: "The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each
row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid (also called "boxes",
"blocks", "regions", or "sub-squares") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle 
setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a unique 
solution."

To implement this program to create a sudoku game, just place the five java files in the 
source folder. This is one of my first attempts at using graphics in Java, so if you have
any tips or need to report any bugs, feel free to use the email on my github
here: https://github.com/dunc-

Otherwise, have fun!

NOTE: The file you run is called "MyBoard.java".
NOTE #2: I did not create "board.png" myself. This image was found through a Google search.
